This is a full 3DS modding guide where you can get all the files you need in one place. You might have to get your own .cia files, but you can do that throught he Universal Updater, and Hshop. If you use Combined.zip, make sure to keep everything the way it is or it wont work. (Unzip the zip file and copy everything to your SD card the way it is.) May this start the revival of the Nintendo 3DS, a console abandoned by its creators. Happy Modding!
